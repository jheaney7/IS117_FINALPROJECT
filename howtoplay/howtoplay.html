                Poker is a thrilling card game played by 2 to 10 players. To start, a dealer is assigned, and two players to the dealer's left place the "small blind" and "big blind" bets. These forced bets ensure thereâ€™s something to play for in the pot. Once the blinds are posted, each player is dealt two private cards, known as "hole cards." These are the cards you use to build your hand.

            The game progresses through a series of betting rounds. The first round, called the "pre-flop," begins after the hole cards are dealt. Starting with the player to the left of the big blind, players must decide to "call" (match the big blind), "raise" (increase the bet), or "fold" (discard their hand and sit out the round). After all players have taken their action, the dealer deals three community cards face-up on the table. This is called the "flop."
            
            The flop is followed by another round of betting, starting with the player to the dealer's left. Players now have more information to decide their next move based on their hole cards and the shared community cards. After the betting round is complete, the dealer reveals the "turn," which is the fourth community card. Another round of betting occurs.
            
            Finally, the "river," or fifth community card, is dealt. This is the last card players can use to form their hand. After one final betting round, any remaining players enter the "showdown." Each player reveals their hole cards, and the dealer or players compare hands to determine the winner. The player with the best five-card hand, using any combination of hole cards and community cards, wins the pot.
            
            Throughout the game, betting decisions and timing are critical. The sequence of betting ensures that the game remains fair and competitive, allowing players to fold, bluff, or play aggressively based on the cards they hold. Poker is a game of information, and every round adds new layers of excitement and decision-making.</p>
